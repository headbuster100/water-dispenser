# water-dispenser
It is a IoT based project which includes arduino nano,ultrasonic sensor,servo motor.
the aim of the project is to get water automatically when we place our glass near water dispenser.
by sensors we can detect the distance which allows servo motor to turn on and we can get water from dispensr autmatically .
